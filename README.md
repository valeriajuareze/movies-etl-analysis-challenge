# Movies ETL Analysis Challenge

## Purpose of the Project
Create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables. I will need to create one function that takes in the three files: 
- Wikipedia data
- Kaggle metadata
- MovieLens rating data

And, also performs the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.
