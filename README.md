# Movies ETL Analysis Challenge

##Purpose of the Project
Create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables. I will need to create one function that takes in the three files—Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data—and performs the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.
